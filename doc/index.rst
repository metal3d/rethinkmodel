   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to RethinkModel's documentation!
========================================

What is this ?
--------------

RethinkModel aims to help you to describe your data as classes to be easilly created, updated and get from RethinkDB_.

Rethink:Model make uses of `typing support`_ annotations - Pyton annotations describe the `model` fields. That's easy, you only have to import the standard `typing` module, and use any of :code:`Optionnal`, :code:`Type`, :code:`List`, :code:`Union`... types.

It's simple as a pie
--------------------

.. code::

    from typing import Optional, Type
    from rethinkdb.model import Model

    class Post(Model):
        author: Type[User]
        content: Type[str]
        tags: Optional[List[str]]

    class User(Model):
        login: Type[str]
        email: Type[str]

    user = User(login="John", email="me@foo.com").save()
    post = Post(author=user, content="This is the post").save()

The goals
---------

- Describe the models in the simplest possible way, but also in the most meaningful way
- Make use of powerful typing package from Python > 3.7
- Avoid type checking at runtime (What ?) but let your IDE punish you

Python is not a staticly typed langage. But Python developers want it (or not ðŸ˜œ) - So there are many Python tools that are designed to use typing package which is integrated with Python SDK: Pyright (use by PyLance), MyPy, PyType...

Your IDE can make type checking.

- Vim can use coc-pyright_
- VsCode can use PyLance_
- PyCharm knows how to manage typing
- etc...

So, let's use typing ! Rethink:Model is designed to use the typing package.
