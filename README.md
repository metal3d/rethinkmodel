Simple and easy to use ORM for [RethinkDB](https://www.rethinkdb.com).
Use Python `typing` package and annotations to describe data
representation.

RethinkModel aims to help you to describe your data as classes to be
easilly created, updated and get from
[RethinkDB](https://www.rethinkdb.com).

Rethink:Model make uses of [typing
support](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html) annotations -
Python annotations describe the model fields. Thatâ€™s easy, you only have
to import the standard `typing` module, and use any of `Optionnal`,
`Type`, `List`, `Union`â€¦ types.

## Itâ€™s simple as a pie

``` python
from typing import Optional, List
from rethinkdb.model import Model

class Post(Model):
    author: User  # One to One relation to User
    content: str
    tags: Optional[List[str]] # use typing, tags can be None

class User(Model):
    login: str
    email: str

# save
user = User(login="John", email="me@foo.com").save()
post = Post(author=user, content="This is the post").save()

# get user
user = User.get(user.id)

# get Post
post = Post.get(post.id)
# post.author is an User, but in DB it's the ID

# get post from User ?
user = User.get(user.id).join(Project)
# user.projects is now filled
```

There are **other methods** like `join()`, `get_all()` and so on. Please
check documentation.

## The goals

  - Describe the models in the simplest possible way, but also in the
    most meaningful way
  - Make use of powerful typing package from Python \> 3.7
  - Avoid type checking at runtime (What ?) but let your IDE punish you

Python is not a staticly typed langage. But Python developers want it
(or not ðŸ˜œ) - So there are many Python tools that are designed to use
typing package which is integrated with Python SDK: Pyright (use by
PyLance), MyPy, PyTypeâ€¦

Your IDE can make type checking.

  - Vim can use
    [coc-pyright](https://github.com/fannheyward/coc-pyright)
  - VsCode can use
    [PyLance](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.vscode-pylance)
  - PyCharm knows how to manage typing
  - etcâ€¦

So, letâ€™s use typing \! Rethink:Model is designed to use the typing
package.
